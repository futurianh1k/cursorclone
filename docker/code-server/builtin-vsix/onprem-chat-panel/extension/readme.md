# On-Prem Chat Panel (Continue on Right)

This extension is bundled with the on-prem PoC code-server image.

What it does:
- On startup, it opens **Continue** in the **right sidebar (auxiliary bar)** and focuses the input.

Why:
- In offline/on-prem environments, the built-in **Copilot Chat** UI may fail (e.g., tries to install `GitHub.copilot-chat`).
- Continue is preconfigured to use the **on-prem AI Gateway** instead.

Manual command:
- `On-Prem: Open Continue Chat on Right Sidebar`
